# Project Overview

This project contains various implementations and examples of different algorithms and data structures in C and HTML.

## Directory Structure
## Files Description

- **btree.c**: Implementation of a B-Tree data structure.
- **btree.h**: Header file for the B-Tree implementation.
- **cgbtree.c**: Another implementation of a B-Tree with additional functionalities.
- **kurt.h**: Header file containing various utility functions and constants.
- **main.c**: Main entry point of the project, demonstrating various functionalities.
- **pow.h**: Header file for a simple proof-of-work blockchain implementation.
- **sha256.h**: Header file for the SHA-256 implementation.

## How to Build

Simply input this in your terminal:
```sh
gcc -o main main.c -lm
```
(If didn't work drop recycle your PC litterally, this is a highly optimised code!!)

## How to Run

After building the programs, you can run them from the terminal. For example, to run the `main` program: (In the name of Allah most gracious most Merciful)
